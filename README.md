This is a version of the Chess Merida font with Fairy pieces added:

* A is a white upsidedown bishop
* S is a black upsidedown bishop
* D is a white upsidedown rook
* F is a black upsidedown rook
* G is a white upsidedown knight
* H is a black upsidedown knight

This allows games with fairy chess pieces, such as Embassy Chess, Grand 
Chess, or Modern Carrera, to have their positions printed out in diagrams.

The following text looks like the starting position for Modern Carrera 
Chess (where an upsidedown rook or bishop also has the knightâ€™s move) in
the Chess Merida Fairy font:

starting positions are included.
