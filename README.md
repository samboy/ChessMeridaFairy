This is a version of the Chess Merida font with Fairy pieces added:

* A is a white upsidedown bishop
* S is a black upsidedown bishop
* D is a white upsidedown rook
* F is a black upsidedown rook
* G is a white upsidedown knight
* H is a black upsidedown knight

This allows games with fairy chess pieces, such as Embassy Chess, Grand 
Chess, or Modern Carrera, to have their positions printed out in diagrams.

The following text looks like the starting position for Modern Carrera 
Chess (where an upsidedown rook or bishop also has the knight’s move) in
the Chess Merida Fairy font:

Note that the font works best on a QWERTY keyboard (since the corresponding
black piece is next to the white piece; e.g. `V` is a black bishop where
`B` is a white bishop).  Uppercase is a dark square; lower case is a 
light square.

Example documents with the Chess, Embassy Chess, and Modern Carrera Chess
starting positions are included.
