This is a version of the Chess Merida font with Fairy pieces added.

Caulixtla009Serif).

# The chess pieces

* A is a white upsidedown bishop
* S is a black upsidedown bishop
* D is a modified white upsidedown rook
* F is a modified black upsidedown rook
* G is a white upsidedown knight
* H is a black upsidedown knight
* P is a white pawn
* O (the letter) is a black pawn
* RNBQK are the expected white pieces (as per English algebraic notation)
* TMVWL are the corresponding black pieces
* A `+` is an empty black square
* A ` ` (blank space) is an empty white square

Uppercase pieces are on black squares; lowercase pieces are on white 
squares.

This modifed version of Chess Merida allows games with fairy chess pieces, 
such as Embassy Chess, Grand Chess, or Modern Carrera, to have their 
positions printed out in diagrams.

The following text looks like the starting position for Modern Carrera 
Chess (where an upsidedown rook or bishop also has the knight’s move) in
the Chess Merida Fairy font:

```

```

Note that the font works best on a QWERTY keyboard (since the corresponding
black piece is next to the white piece; e.g. `V` is a black bishop where
`B` is a white bishop).  Uppercase is a dark square; lower case is a 
light square.

Example documents with the Chess, Embassy Chess, and Modern Carrera Chess
starting positions are included.  Both Word 2003 and RTF (rich text format)
versions of the documents are included.
